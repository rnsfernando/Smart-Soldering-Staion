```c
// Example Code Snippet
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>

#define F_CPU 16000000UL

int main(void) {
    // Set up code
    DDRB |= (1 << PB0); // Set PB0 as output

    while (1) {
        // Main loop
        PORTB ^= (1 << PB0); // Toggle PB0
        _delay_ms(1000); // Delay 1 second
    }
    return 0;
}
